# Bruin Market

Weâ€™re sure there have been countless times when students no longer needed something they had and wanted to get rid of it to make some quick money. But uploading them on well-known e-commerce sites like eBay or Amazon, avoiding scammers, and dealing with shipping is a hassle, especially for small items worth just a few dollars. BruinMarket is a client/server app exclusively for UCLA students to buy and sell items amongst verified UCLA students.
